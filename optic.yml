        # Documentation
        - "All operations MUST have a description, operationId, and summary."
        # - "Operation parameters MUST have a description."
        # - "Parameter descriptions MUST explain how the client uses the parameter, not what the parameter is. Bad: “the start date” Good: “set this parameter to the earliest date you want to receive records from”."

        # Naming Conventions
        - "All operation URL paths with multiple words MUST be named using hyphen-case (ie: /operation-events/{id})." 
        - "All operation URL paths be nouns, not verbs."
        - "All operation URL paths MUST be plural nouns, not singular."

        # Status Codes
        - 'POST requests should return a 201 or 202 status on success instead of 200.'
        - '200 response bodies should not be used to return errors. Those must use 4xx or 5xx.'

        # Completeness
        - "GET requests that have an ID at the end of their path (ie /teams/{teamID}) should define a 404."
        - "Properties that sounds like they are dates should use format: datetime or format: timestamp"

        # Security
        - "GET requests that have an ID in their path must not have a 'type: integer' or 'type: numeric', instead being a string with format: uuid or format: ulid. Good: '/things/61f423e5-3cac-4e82-a520-b233730637bb'. Bad: '/things/1234'."

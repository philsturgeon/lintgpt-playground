        # Documentation
        - "All operations MUST have a description, operationId, and summary."
        # - "Operation parameters MUST have a description."
        # - "Parameter descriptions MUST explain how the client uses the parameter, not what the parameter is. Bad: “the start date” Good: “set this parameter to the earliest date you want to receive records from”."

        # Naming Conventions
        # - "All operation URL path components with multiple words MUST be named using hyphen-case (ie: /operation-events/{id})." 
        - "All operation URL path components MUST be nouns, not verbs."
        - "All operation URL path components MUST be plural nouns, not singular."

        # Content Types
        - "Response bodies for errors SHOULD use a media type of application/vnd.api+json, application/problem+json, or application/problem+xml to signal the use of a proper problem document."

        # Status Codes
        # - 'POST requests should return a 201 or 202 status on success instead of 200'
        # - '200 response bodies should not be used to return errors. Those must use 4xx or 5xx'

        # Completeness
        # - "GET requests that have an ID at the end of their path (ie /teams/{teamID}) should define a 404"
        # - "Properties that sounds like they are dates should use format: datetime or format: timestamp"

        # Standards Compliance
        # - All request headers must avoid having a name that starts with "X-".

        # Security
        # - "All operations MUST have a security scheme defined"

        # TODO Trying to get uuid better than auto-incrementing numbers rule to work.
        # - "All operation parameters with 'name: id' should use format: uuid or format: ulid so that sequential numbers cannot be used to leak data"

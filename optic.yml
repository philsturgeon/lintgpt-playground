        # Design
        - "Endpoints MUST be nouns, not verbs."
        - "Endpoints MUST be plural nouns, not singular."


        # Documentation
        - "Endpoints MUST have a description, operationId, and summary."
        - "Operation parameters MUST have a description."
        - "Parameter descriptions MUST explain how the client uses the parameter, not what the parameter is. Bad: “the start date” Good: “set this parameter to the earliest date you want to receive records from”."

        # Status Codes
        - 'POST requests should return a 201 or 202 status on success instead of 200.'
        - '200 response bodies should not be used to return errors. Those must use 4xx or 5xx.'

        # Completeness
        - "GET requests that have an ID at the end of their path (ie /teams/{teamID}) should define a 404."
        - "Properties that sounds like they are dates should use format: datetime or format: timestamp"
